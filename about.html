        <h2 class="page-title">About Me</h2>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>I'll try to keep it short.</p>
            
            <p>I am extremely hard working, highly curious, and want to build companies from the ground-up. I want to be in startups, care about developing culture, possess clarity and am long on longevity. I am extremely clear on it being a force to be reckoned with over the next couple of decades.</p>
            
            <p>I can work in any business operation; be it hiring, supply chain, grunt work, smart work, building a partnership, making tough decisions, gaming a system, strategising new product lines; whatever is needed for the betterment of the company. </p>
            
            <p>This is not to say that I know everything. Like I am sure I made a few (if not more!) missteps in my analysis and future path for Temple, I will also learn as the company grows. However, I am eager to understand where I am wrong and am a quick learner.</p>
            
            <p>I also want to be upfront. I am fat, but I'm on my journey to becoming thinner. I have lost 25kgs, pay immense focus on my sleep, diet and exercise and am overall highly focused on improving my health on a daily basis.</p>
            
            <p>As mentioned on the home page, I can start working at Temple full time as soon as my college ends (December 17th) and can work online (and/or 3 days a week in Gurgaon) until then. This is purely limited due to my last semester of college in Chandigarh.</p>
            
            <p>I am extremely keen and excited to build the future with you guys.</p>
            
            <p>You can find out more about me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemant-g/" target="_blank" class="content-link">LinkedIn</a> or via my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10T9E2PQHWitv1Cjb-V5KyLP2gs3qIYCA/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="content-link">resume</a>.</p>
