            <p>Hi! üëã</p>
            
            <p>I am Hemant, a final year UG student at Plaksha University. I am extremely high agency, eager to learn and delusionally optimistic. <a href="about.html" class="content-link">Read more about me ‚Üí</a></p>
            
            <p>I have been excited about Continue / Temple's proposition for quite some time and this website showcases my understanding of it + how I would take it forward. As you‚Äôll realise through my understanding, the target consumer is someone who‚Äôs interested in longevity / bio-hacking.</p>
            <p>Someone like this may not necessarily go to the extent of a Bryan Johnson. It‚Äôs just someone who‚Äôs more interested in actively improving their health when compared to an average person, be that in terms of improving what they eat, understanding how to best exercise, or measuring and putting numbers to their day-to-day activities. It‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs willing to go past the health lores of old and actually understand what their body needs to have a better lifespan and/or healthspan.</p>

                <p><u>Why this is personal:</u></p>
                <p>I was overweight when I entered college, and I just piled on top of that: with food, a bad sleep schedule and no exercise, believing I could stretch my body. I was wrong, and hit many breaking points, but what led to a change was a project I did in the 4th semester of college focused around sleep & Bryan Johnson‚Äôs blueprint. It led me to read ‚ÄòWhy We Sleep‚Äô and actually understand the importance of sleep. Prior to the 4th semester, I was infamous for ‚Äúneeding no sleep,‚Äù however, once I decided to improve my sleep duration and schedule, it felt like my life had changed. I was never tired, even more high-energy than earlier, more focused, less forgetful and so much more. It felt like my life had changed. I‚Äôm infamous now too, but it‚Äôs because more often than not, I'm the first person to hit the hay.</p>
                <p><strong>I‚Äôve been fat, fit, fat and now on the journey to be fit again. I understand the importance of focusing on one‚Äôs health and how everything (literally every single aspect of daily life) gets shot to hell if you don‚Äôt.</strong></p>

                <p>I can start working at Temple full time as soon as my college ends (December 17th) and can work online (and/or 3 days a week in Gurgaon) till then. This is purely limited due to the last semester of college in Chandigarh.</p>
