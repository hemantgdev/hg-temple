        <div class="content">
            <p>The primary purpose for making this was to understand how we can price ourselves and the target audiences we can cover. I am not covering levels of accuracy in this table.</p>

            <p>We track a lot of the metrics that are tracked by Oura, Ultrahuman & WHOOP, however, our advantage comes in with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The brain & jaw related metrics that we track that allow us to introduce features that they can perhaps never release.</li>
                <li>The accuracy of the features we have in common is bound to be either better or similar to that of our competitors' devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <details>
                <summary><u><span style="margin-left: 4px;">Why our accuracy for some metrics is bound to be higher</span></u></summary>
                <div style="margin-left: 12px; margin-top: 8px;">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sleep insights will be better for us as we're measuring EEG as well, which is something no one else has access to. Measurements around recovery will also be better due to the same reason.</li>
                        <li>We can better track HR as we're measuring the pulse at the temporal artery, which will give a better reading than at the wrist / finger.</li>
                        <li>Skin temperature measurements will be more reflective of systemic changes and reacts much faster to changes as compared to a sensor at the wrist / finger.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </details>
            <br>

            <p>This will allow us to not only target the current consumer base of Ultrahuman, WHOOP & Oura, who is quite often a buyer who cares about incremental differences and makes an informed decision, but also target a whole new market that's focused on measuring productivity, brain activity and other head / brain related metrics throughout the day.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Pricing:</h3>
            
            <p>I must admit, I strongly debated a flat pricing strategy versus a subscription based one. Initially, after seeing <a href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/documents/annual-report-2024/" target="_blank" class="content-link">Ultrahuman's 2024 report</a>, I felt that the gifting boom that comes with one-time-pay products is a good reason to opt for this route, but if google search trends are to be taken as proxy, then subscription based businesses like Oura & Whoop also see similar trends during the holiday season.</p>

            <p>I believe we should begin with a no-subscription model to ensure we have cashflow in the beginning and then later on, subsidise the base product price while introducing a subscription. We can take this a step further by introducing something akin to PowerPlugs by Ultrahuman or the tiered subscription that WHOOP offers.</p>

            <p>We should look to price the product (regardless of a flat pricing or subscription based model) somewhere between $200 - $450, in the ranges similar to other such products.</p>

            <p><strong>Pricing of other longevity / bio-hacking focused products:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Oura Ring: $350 + $70 - $72 per year in subscription fees</li>
                <li>Ultrahuman Ring Air: Flat Pricing: $350</li>
                <li>WHOOP: $199 - $359 (dependent on the plan)</li>
                <li>Samsung Galaxy Ring: Flat Pricing: $400</li>
            </ul>
