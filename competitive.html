                <p><strong>We can actually be an all-in-one platform that is relevant for everything from sleep to meals to exercise. I believe we hold a very interesting place in the market where we are bound to have more accurate (as per my understanding) measurements, a greater number of measurements and most importantly, the most potential to introduce more features. I think we have a great chance to cover large amounts of market share simply because of the nature of the consumer, who is (more often than not) a buyer who cares about incremental differences and makes an informed decision.</strong></p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Pricing:</h3>
            
            <p>I must admit, I am confused about our pricing strategy and whether we should proceed with a flat pricing strategy or a subscription based one. Initially, after seeing <a href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/documents/annual-report-2024/" target="_blank" class="content-link">Ultrahuman's 2024 report</a>, I felt that the gifting boom that comes with one-time-pay products is a good reason to opt for this route, but if google search trends are to be taken as proxy, then subscription based businesses like Oura & Whoop also see similar trends during the holiday season.</p>
            
            <p>I believe we should begin with a no-subscription model to ensure we have cashflow in the beginning and then later on, subsidise the base product price while introducing a subscription. We can take this a step further by introducing something akin to PowerPlugs by Ultrahuman or the tiered subscription that WHOOP offers.</p>
