        <div class="content">
            <p>I was intrigued when the name was changed from Continue to Temple. However, after a few quick google and GPT searches, I realised that perhaps the only possibility could be a device meant to be attached to the body at the temple.</p>

            <p>After a fair amount of prompting, these were the outcomes that I was able to come to that Temple could potentially be exploring. This could be highly optimistic to the point of being outrageous, but this is what I found was possible and useful.</p>
            
            <h3>Biomarkers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HR & RHR</li>
                <li>HRV</li>
                <li>Chewing Activity</li>
                <li>Skin Temperature</li>
                <li>Respiratory Rate</li>
                <li>Blink metrics</li>
                <li>SpOâ‚‚</li>
                <li>EEG</li>
                <li>EDA</li>
                <li>ECG, Blood Pressure, A-Fib, fNIRS (will require some form of FDA Approval which'll delay time to market)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>We can develop a fair number of features using these biomarkers that are either more accurate or unique when compared to what's already in the market.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Based on cursory readings across forums discussing other biomarker measurement devices, here are some of the features that users ask for from their current devices:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Walking Pad detection: Allowing the device to understand that physical exertion is taking place even though the person is working.</li>
                <li>Extra Attention Mode: People often worry about about their vitals after getting a vaccine or after they participate in an activity that they expect to impact their body. Perhaps we can make the interaction of the app with the user more pro-active during these times along with unlocking any aspects of the device that we otherwise use occasionally / momentarily.</li>
                <li>Selective Automatic Activity Detection: Exists in Apple Watch, but a problem across other wearables.</li>
                <li>Meal Logging: Tends to be a common feature request as people want an app to be their master app. I think we can do this in a great way, especially due to bruxism detection.</li>
                <li>Notifications to Family: Exists in Apple Watch, but a common feature request across other wearables.</li>
            </ul>
