        <div class="content">
            <p>I was intrigued when the name was changed from Continue to Temple. However, after a few quick google and GPT searches, I realised that perhaps the only possibility could be a device meant to be attached to the body at the temple.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">

            <p>After a fair amount of prompting, these were the outcomes that I was able to come to that Temple could potentially be exploring. This could be highly optimistic to the point of being outrageous, but this is what I found was possible and useful.</p>
            
            <h3>Biomarkers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HR & RHR</li>
                <li>HRV</li>
                <li>Chewing Activity</li>
                <li>Skin Temperature</li>
                <li>Respiratory Rate</li>
                <li>Blink metrics</li>
                <li>SpO₂</li>
                <li>EEG</li>
                <li>EDA</li>
                <li>ECG, Blood Pressure, A-Fib, fNIRS (will require some form of FDA Approval which'll delay time to market)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sleep Tracking</li>
                <li>Focus & Productivity Monitoring</li>
                <li>Screen Comfort & Eye Health</li>
                <li>Stress & Calmness Tracking</li>
                <li>Meal Logging & Mindful Eating Support</li>
                <li>Neck & Head Posture</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Basis these fundamental features, we can introduce a plethora of support features (that also venture into the territory of providing suggestions for improvements) like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sleep Fragility Insights: Tracks how easily one wakes up at night and offers tips to improve your sleep environment and habits.</li>
                <li>Flow State Coaching: Guides one into and helps maintain deep focus. We can further extend this to notify users of optimal break timings.</li>
                <li>Drowsiness Detection: Identifies signs of drowsiness and prompts one to move or change the environment before fatigue starts impacting them.</li>
                <li>Fever Detection: Essentially, pre-emptively predicting if the person is bound to be ill due to higher temperature (something similar to what Ultrahuman is already doing).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Based on cursory readings across forums discussing other biomarker measurement devices, here are some of the features that users ask for from their current devices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extra Attention Mode + Planning Ahead: People often worry about about their vitals after getting a vaccine or after they participate in an activity that they expect to impact their body. Perhaps we can make the interaction of the app with the user more pro-active during these times along with unlocking any aspects of the device that we otherwise use occasionally / momentarily.</li>
                <li>Similarly, we can add a 'add your flights' feature for when one is travelling across the globe, and we can then give suggestions on alterations that one should make to their sleep schedule to minimise jetlag (of course supported by data around their recent sleep schedule)</li>
                <li>Selective Automatic Activity Detection: Exists in Apple Watch, but a problem across other wearables.</li>
                <li>Meal Logging: Tends to be a common feature request as people want an app to be their master app. I think we can do this in a great way, especially due to jaw movement detection.</li>
                <li>Notifications to Family: Exists in Apple Watch, but a common feature request across other wearables.</li>
                <li>Walking Pad detection: Allowing the device to understand that physical exertion is taking place even when the person is working at a desk and their hands are lying still.</li>
            </ul>
