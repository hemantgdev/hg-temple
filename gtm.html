            <p>I think Ultrahuman and WHOOP have done this really well as they've essentially become global products. We also need to do the same, however, I believe it's best to begin in larger markets and then return to India (when its longevity market will also be booming).</p>
            
            <p>It seems ideal to begin in one of 2 places:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>USA / North America</li>
                <li>UAE</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This thesis comes from 2 things primarily:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Almost all market research reports state that the biohacking / longevity market is largest in the USA right now, which also makes sense with their higher propensity to pay.</li>
                <li>Taking Google Search Trends as proxy for interest in our competitors' products also develops a good idea about the markets in which they're most popular.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>So, in our case, when going to market, I believe we need to solve for 2 things primarily: <strong>Credibility & Reach</strong></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>It makes sense to take a longform-first approach as our audience is smarter, less likely to be teased by short clickbait reels or ads, especially considering that the price point will be significant. This will help with both credibility and reach.<br>
                (see: <a href="youtubers.html" target="_blank" class="content-link">repository of youtubers</a> | <a href="blogs.html" target="_blank" class="content-link">repository of blogs</a>)</li>
                
                <li>We can also increase both credibility and reach in local communities by partnerships with gyms, gym trainers & health studios in the US. (see: <a href="gyms.html" target="_blank" class="content-link">repository</a>)</li>
                
                <li>As tired as the idea may sound, a Temple podcast would be quite useful and would actually work. Not only will it allow us to have greater reach and show the people building the brand (which adds trust), but we can also create greater credibility for the brand by having a network of Temple Partners who are top minds in the longevity field and we organise meetups / discussions with these people. The podcast also helps greatly in this longer-term goal of the network.</li>
                
                <li>We can use Deepinder's network to introduce this device into communities like YPO, EO, Offline Club and others which are focused on increasing both their lifespan & healthspan and have disposable income. This would help with credibility, with some of the top minds in the world wearing our product.</li>
                
                <li>We can expand our US reach through college and club sports partnerships. The younger generation shows heightened health awareness, and partnerships with college teams should be fairly accessible and cost-effective. This is the WHOOP approach, extrapolated to this context and would be helpful as these sportspersons are popular in their relatively smaller college communities, but they also go on to represent US at an international level and this allows us to 'catch them young'.<br>
                <span class="note-text">(focus on baseball could also help us break into the Japan market, which is also touted as one of the frontrunners in longevity awareness)</span></li>
                
                <li>The obvious, yet important way to increase reach is to be on the platforms where our users are. This includes Walmart, Target, Amazon, Best Buy.<br>
                This is a slightly longer process (due to US entity registration etc.) and requirements differ slightly for each retailer. Even if we were to satisfy these, we would still only be listed on the online store, and would need a buyer (all these retailers have middlemen buyers who then sell the stuff to the retailers) who vets us and then puts us in these stores.<br>
                Even though they are our competitors (but are ex-Zomans), talking to Ultrahuman founders could be great help as they've cracked this code and even gotten into Costco & sam's club.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Outside of concerns for the product, with respect to concerns for GTM, I believe we need to figure out a way to reduce the gestation period of the product. For a product like the Ultrahuman Ring Air, it was a month, with the early reviews I have been able to find for the product from <a href="https://dreamspan.co/" class="content-link">https://dreamspan.co/</a>, it's less than a week.</p>
            
            <p>We need to reduce the gestation period to ensure that word of mouth / credibility building starts earlier.</p>
